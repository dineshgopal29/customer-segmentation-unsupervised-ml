# Customer Segmentation using PCA and Kmeans Unsupervised Algorithm
Problem Statement: Analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. We will use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, we'll apply what we've learned on a dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company.
